experiment_description: This dataset was used in the study 'Multidimensional population
    activity in an electrically coupled inhibitory circuit in the cerebellar cortex'
    by Gurnani and Silver in Neuron, 2021. It includes pre-processed two-photon imaging
    data and behavioural data from head-fixed awake mice exhibiting spontaneous whisking
    and locomotion on a cylindrical wheel.
